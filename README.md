# OpenGL Raycaster
This is the code from 3DSage's YouTube video!
I recommend watching the video, so, you follow along and see what each part does and how it works but here is the code if you need help. Thank you for the support, postive feedback, and comments! 
Note: Keep the window size the same as it opens to look correct.
